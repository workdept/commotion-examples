# Commotion Sample Apps Repp

This repository contains a OpenWrt feed folder for sample applications and libs
that will be required for apps that run using the Commotion OpenWrt system.

Currently it contains the following:

1. libwebsockets - C Websockets library and a test app.
  @todo - Install startup script for demo app. 
  @todo - Install html and js on Luci pages.

2. ws-uv - Websockets using c and libuv, though I found this library to contain many issues in implementations.
